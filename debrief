  <p>Firstly, the research team would like to thank you for participating in this project.</p>

  <p>In this study, you viewed a series of social-media-style posts containing political claims attributed to either a Democrat or a Republican. After each post, you estimated how likely other members of both your own political group (in-group) and the opposing political group (out-group) would endorse the same claim. The aim was to examine whether people infer that members of an opposing political group all share similar beliefs after only one member voices an opinion—a cognitive bias known as <em>out-group homogeneity</em>.</p>

  <p>We also investigated whether this tendency is stronger when the initial claim is misinformation rather than accurate information, and whether the strength of your own partisan identity affects how strongly you generalise these beliefs across groups.</p>

  <p>Understanding out-group homogeneity is important because such biases can hinder productive political dialogue and facilitate the spread of misinformation. By clarifying the psychological mechanisms behind this bias, we hope to inform strategies that reduce political polarisation and improve the effectiveness of corrective information.</p>

  <p>The statements you saw were selected for experimental purposes and included both accurate and false political claims. To ensure you leave the study without misconceptions, we have provided a fact-checking document that details the factual status of each claim. We encourage you to review this information carefully.</p>
